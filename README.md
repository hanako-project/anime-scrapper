# anime-scapper
Forked from [manami-project/anime-offline-database](https://github.com/manami-project/anime-offline-database).

This is the \*perhaps\* the improved version from the original. 
I added some field that I think it needed in the database. 

### To do
- Add concurrency when crawling
- Add other parsing method from other source (currently only MAL)
- Add error logging 
  
### Contribution
Feel free to contribute and improve my spaghetti code here
